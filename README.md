# Python Libraries Learning Repository

This repository contains my learning journey with various Python libraries. Each folder within this repository corresponds to a specific library and contains code examples, exercises, and notes that I used to understand and practice these libraries.

## Libraries Covered

- **Matplotlib**: 2D plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing with powerful array objects.
- **OOP in Python**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python.
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and image processing.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization built on top of Matplotlib.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

```plaintext
.
├── Matplotlib/
├── NumPy/
├── OOP/
├── OpenCV/
├── Pandas/
└── Seaborn/
```

- **Matplotlib/**: Contains examples of various plots like line plots, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
- **NumPy/**: Includes exercises on array creation, manipulation, mathematical operations, and linear algebra.
- **OOP/**: Contains code demonstrating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **OpenCV/**: Includes scripts related to image processing, video processing, and object detection.
- **Pandas/**: Contains scripts and notebooks that cover data manipulation, DataFrames, series operations, handling missing data, and more.
- **Seaborn/**: Showcases the use of Seaborn for statistical plots such as boxplots, violin plots, and heatmaps.
